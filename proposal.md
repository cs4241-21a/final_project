# Gompei Clicker #

Nicholas Markou, Kiara Munz, Benjamin Gelinas, Liam Rathke, Adam Grabowski

General Description: 

We will be creating a clicker game with a WPI theme! Interface will include references to WPI facilities, clubs, and events in the form of upgrades. Players will be able to earn goatbucks by upgrading their goatbucks per click and automatic goatbucks per second. The application will feature five levels for each type of upgrade, as well as a leaderboard to see who has the most goatbucks that updates every minute.

## Technologies: ##

The technologies we will use for this project are Express, Vue, and MongoDb. We will use express to handle creating the node.js server, Vue for a component based frontend javascript framework and MongoDb for storage of data. User data will only update while they have the tab open.

The data MongoDB will hold is:
- Currency in bank per user
- Currency generated total
- Buildings purchased
- Upgrades purchased
- Account information

## Game Assets: ##

Currency: Goatbucks
5 purchasable buildings:
- Campus Center
- Fuller
- AK
- Innovation Studio
- Smart World

Each building and clicks can get upgrades, some examples:
- Dunkin Donuts for CC
- Construction upgrade for Smart World
- More students per building
- Petzels and Smoothies at Innovation Studio
- Daka cookies increase click goatbuck rate

You can upgrade the value of each click or the currency per second generated by purchased buildings
