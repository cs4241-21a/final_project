Final Project Proposal
CS 4241 A21
Prof. Roberts

For our project, we will create a web application that is a universal wishlist for items that you are considering buying online. What can the website do?
User login and registration
Easy way to save wanted items when shopping online (Chrome extension?)
Save items uniformly  
Search, edit and organize items and collections
Share items and collections, providing option to vote and comment on the item

Our plan is to have a Website application as the host of our project. This website will be where users will be able to register, login, organize, and check their saved collections of items in the wishlist. 

The idea is that users are able to download a chrome extension, that will be able to get the website link for the item, and send it to a specific item collection in the host website application. Users will also have the option to manually add items on the website. We will store picture(s), description, name, price, and the seller/website for each item. Once added to one of their collections they would be able to edit/organize their items as they please from the website.
To store the data (users, items, and collections) we are planning on using a relational database such as Oracle or MySQL. We plan to use Java for the backend. We are considering using React for the front-end but we do not have much experience with it so we may use JS, HTML, and CSS instead. We will be researching libraries that could be beneficial for us to use for this website. 
 
Features that we will add if we have time:
Users can search for items on the website among their collections.
Users can add tags to collections to filter them by.
Users can share collections with other people (accounts or emails)
View and Edit permissions
Users can upvote and downvote items in a collection.
Users can set reminders on specific items.
For the extension, if it cannot find all of the info it will request for the user to manually add in the missing parts.

Please let us know if our scope is too small or big. We are particularly interested in your thoughts on using a chrome extension.
