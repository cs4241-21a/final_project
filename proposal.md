## Description

This application uses a Genshin Impact API to assist users in time/resource management by creating a user friendly interface for the api.  This application queries the api to serve the relevant data relating to a user's choice of characters, weapons, and artifacts. We will be using a database to store users and their preferences.

### Side Note
This project closely resembles a [pre-existing application](https://genshin.poporing.life/).  We have approval from Professor Charlie.
