## Overview
Our project idea for this term is to create a web-based text editor for writing scripts or other text-based files. It will have dynamic code colouring for a handful of languages we can implement. It will also have the ability to upload or download files to your system, as well as naming, changing extensions, or reformatting the files used. Users will be able to save their status to their account, and upon logging in will see where they left off, unless manually cleared. 

## Technologies:
- We will be using a Node.js backend
- MongoDB Database for storage
- There are a number of CSS frameworks existing for highlighting code, we will pick one that suits our application style best.
- We will be using React to make the user interface (though it may become Svelte)
