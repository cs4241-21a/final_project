## Brief Explanation of Idea
Mental health is a broad and complicated subject. We want to present people with statistics and information about mental health and suicide in a way that is engaging and helps people relate to those numbers on a more personal level. Though the statistics themselves are important, it can be easy to forget numbers and thus an interactive overview of statistics on mental health and suicide may not be as impactful. Therefore, we want the site visitors to also have the ability to be more introspective. Site visitors will have the opportunity to answer questions about their life and experiences, then see information about how they compare to the broader population, as well as how that might be relevant to mental health or sucide. 

As well as the more personal interactive form, we also will have an interactive overview of various statistics relating to mental health and suicide we aggregated from high quality sources. The site will also anonymously record peoplesâ€™ responses to questions and provide some comparison of population level trends versus what people on the site responded with. This site will not be a diagnostic tool, and that will be made clear during the survey.

### Possible data sources and topics of inquiry
Depression as measured by the PHQ-9
- https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.201500149
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8222572/

Assessment of possible risk factors for suicide
- Risk factors like
  - Having ADHD, anxiety, or other diagnoses
  - Sexuality and gender identity
  - Age
  - COVID/global pandemic

Factors that correlate/causally link to better mental health
- Exercise
- Therapy

## Technologies We Will Use

- React
- Typescript
- Some way of producing graphs/visualization
  - D3.js
  - Canvas
  - Various libraries that wrap those

### Backend
- Node w/ Express
- Likely javascript
- MongoDB for data storage

### Other
- Possibly R/Python for data cleaning
