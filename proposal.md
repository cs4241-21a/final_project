### Outline
We want to create a workout tracking tool. Some of the main features include: creating custom workout routines, a form that takes any data from a particular workout (including target muscle group), graph display of progress with the ability to filter on certain criteria. Users will be able to create their own account. If time allows, we think it would be a cool idea to implement a leaderboard. 


#### Key Technologies
- Express Server
- MongoDB
- D3
