Group 9 - Owen, Steven, Duncan, Michael, Andrew

We have two proposals as we figure out which one is better.

# Proposal 1 - Dinder
Ever been with your friends trying to find somewhere to eat and you just can't find anything?

Here comes us making a Tinder-like app to swipe on nearby restauraunts with all your friends, then seeing how you all voted at the end.

## How this would work
One friend would launch the web app, enter the location of where you're trying to eat, filter by rating, price, etc, then create a new session. You'd share a session link to your friends, thaen you'd all swipe on restauraunts before seeing which restauraunts were swiped on most.

## Technologies we'd use
* Google Maps API to get restauraunt details, then to be fed into the Web UI
* Web UI written in React
* MongoDB to store swiping sessions and match results
* WebSockets to communicate between clients about the swipe sessions
* Express would host the server.

# Proposal 2 - Laundry Connect 2: Electric Boogaloo
WPI has a serious problem. Say you want to check the status of a laundry room and see how busy it is (https://laundryconnect.net/wpifounders.aspx for instance). More specifically - on your phone. Wait, what's that? Do I hear the sounds of 2000s web design?

Here comes us making the laundry status page much, much better, with such buzzwords as Material Design, React, Node.JS, Blockchain, ML, and AI.

## How this would work
You'd launch the Laundry Connect 2 website to get an overview of laundry room availability (% dryers/washers available). Then, you could go into a laundry room to see specific machines available.

You could also make an account to make specific laundry rooms favorited.

## Technologies we'd use
* Web scraper in Node.JS to get the data from Laundry Connect.
* Web UI written in React
* MongoDB to store laundry room availability, user logins,
* Express would host the server.
