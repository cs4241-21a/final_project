## Proposal For Group 10

# Summary
has this ever happened to you?
"oh no, i have 20 versions of my resume for different jobs D:"
well look no further, because [insert name here] is the solution for you

A resume building website that allows users to keep track of a 'master' resume and easily remix it to tailor for specific jobs. It would have 3 main components:
- Master page - Creating the master resume itself (Title, Date, Location, bullet points for each project/experience)
- Remixing page - drag and drop specific items from the master resume into the page. Easily export to PDF
- Reviewing page - share the resume with someone and have a live review session with comments
- Version page - browse through the versions of your resume and organize them into folders

# Technologies
- React for the main webpage design (Typescript)
- Websockets for real time connection between the reviewers
- MongoDB for the backend storage
- Express server for the API
  - Authentication to store the data with your account
