 Project Description:
 
  Every one of our group members are part of the football team. We are planning on creating an app like LinkedIn, but for WPI athletic alumni 
  to connect with current WPI athletes for potential job hirings. The database would ideally have 2 views, one for current athletes looking for jobs 
  and one for WPI athletic alumni who are searching for potential hires. User information and files (resumes, pictures, etc.), will have to be stored
  in the databse for athletes, while alumni would be able to store information about the companies that they represent. 
  
  We plan to use either React or Svelte, express, mongodb, and possibly other libraries.
