# DeAd MeMe HuH?
A meme relevancy tracker to making sure you’re hip with the kids
 
## Concept:
When a user goes on the site they are shown a picture of a meme template (like Bad Luck Brian or “It’s all __? Always has been”) and examples of the meme. A user needs to vote on whether they believe the meme is dead or not then they will be asked if they think it is funny. Once they have done that, they are shown the overall statistics for how dead the community has voted the meme to be as well as if people think it’s funny. They can then move to the next meme and vote again.

## Views:
Home screen -> 
Button that says show me random meme
Search a meme from database
Meme image view : side next to meme statistics 
Cascading animation for meme’s to appear on screen after hitting yes or no to differentiate how the meme will appear on screen. 
Examples of meme with the template
After you answer the prompt it will show the percentage of yeses vs nos
Stats sidebar that shows the memes in least dead (most relevant) to most dead
After hitting yes or no that question fades out and another (do you think its funny anyway) fades in. after answering that the stats on both questions fades in.
