# Project Proposal

Team Members:



* Taylor Cox
* Geoffrey Garsson
* Garrett Sheehan

Our plan for this project is to develop a calendar app that uses nested calendars to improve task management and organization. With this application, you can have multiple calendars for several aspects of your life such as different classes or group projects. For example, a calendar for classes would contain multiple separate calendars for each of your classes, and an event for signing up for classes at the end of the term. Then, in the subsequent lower calendars, there would be events for each class, such as due dates, class times, etc. Users would be able to create, edit, and delete events and calendars, as well as show and hide certain calendars to get a more comprehensive view of their schedule.

The main technologies we plan for using with this project are React for the frontend, Passport.js for github user authentication, and Mongodb to store a userâ€™s calendar data.

Key Technologies:



* React
* Passport
* Mongodb
* TypeScript (?)

Stretch Goals:



* Gantt Chart Implementation
* TypeScript
