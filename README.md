<h2>Memory Game (similar to Simon says):</h2>

Players would join a lobby (represented as an id) in which they are given a sequence of color tiles and all the players need to repeat the sequence. The sequences will get longer by 1 each every round (and faster) as the game progresses. The game will end when there is only one player left in the game.

<h3>Technologies:</h3>

* Express + Node.js  

* Passport.js: Allow user to login using a GitHub account  

* React for frontend

* MongoDB  
  * User information including username and high scores  
  * Leaderboard page to display high scores  
  * Lobbies for multiplayer: generate a room key for other players to join from that key
