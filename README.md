## Description of Project
Stakeholders & Targeted Audience:
When the team came up with this idea our ideal audience is highschool to college students. As college students, our current age group has been defined by the content we consume and produce on social media. Times are ever changing and to keep up with them, we decided to create "Dead Meme Huh?" to check the relevancy of memes within our age group and the one's surrounding it. While there are not many years between ourselves and highschoolers, it is enough to redefine meme culture as we might not always understand their creations compared to creations of our generation. The team name took inspiration from CS 1101 where question marks are referred to as "Huh" and exclamation points are referred to as "Bang". We try to keep the "Dead-Dillo-Huh" meme alive through or team.

When a user goes on the site they are shown a picture of a meme template (like Bad Luck Brian or “It’s all __? Always has been”) and examples of the meme. A user needs to vote on whether they believe the meme is dead or not then they will be asked if they think it is funny. Once they have done that, they are shown the overall statistics for how dead the community has voted the meme to be as well as if people think it’s funny.

Challenges Faced By The Group:
Database connections were hard as we could not get it functional but we designed the page regardless to show what the page would have looked like. The same can be said for the search bar as we lacked the database connections to view memes and receive them, it was difficult to implement such a feature that relied on inputting information and querying that data. Decided to implement a custom version as there were build errors and issues with receiving randomized links read from csv's. Slick was difficult to work with while incorporating this feature and the team saw best to pursue a customized slick that suited our interests, since there was errors with the jQuery usage in the Slick build.
