# Final Project
Team Members: Keval Ashara, Orest Ropi, Daniel Stusalitus

Project Description: A Whiteboard style task-tracking app. Users will be able to create tasks and move them about to organize them in any way they want on the webpage. To organize items, users will be able to create nested subtasks, lists, and containers to group tasks. Other basic options found in similar apps will be implemented as well, such as setting due dates and adding descriptions.

Potential stretch goals for the project if we have time include implementing a Login/Registration page and communal task boards so multiple users can work together and organize group projects.

Key Technologies: 
Express - To run server
MongoDB - To store data
Node.js - As our back-end
Bootstrap - CSS framework
EJS - HTML formatting
