We created a game that promotes the fight against COVID. The gompei avatar has to shoot masks at the COVID viruses flying towards him from all different directions. Score is calculated by how long the player has stayed alive and how many viruses are hit. High scores are displayed on the High Score page. https://corona-game.glitch.me/

An outline of the technologies we used and how we used them:
 - WebSockets for real-time server/client communication for multiplayer
 - p5.js for implementing the game
 - Canvas to draw the game on
 - NES.css for styling our buttons and forms
 - Google fonts for uniform text styles
 - Mongodb for database management

What challenges we faced in completing the project:
 - The server kept resetting if someone was editing the page while someone else was testing it
Setting up multiplayer co-op
