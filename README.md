Memory Game (similar to Simon says):

Players would join a lobby (represented as an id) in which they are given a sequence of color tiles and all the players need to repeat the sequence. The sequences will get longer by 1 each every round (and faster) as the game progresses. The game will end when there is only one player left in the game.
